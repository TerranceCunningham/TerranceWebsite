                        <h4>Dental Hygiene Mobile Services Website Creation.</h4>
                	<p>Dental Hygiene Mobile Services was created by Theresa Marks who has been in the Dental Hygiene field for over 20 years. Theresa has found that she could help more people by traveling to their homes and giving them the care they need there. While working in the dentist field she relized that a large percentage of people needed help but where unable to make it to her offices due to either old age or disabilities.<a class="view_site" href="theresa-website/index.html" target="_new">View Site</a>

                            <p> While discussing the Dental Hygiene Mobile Services site with Theresa I found out that she also needed a logo as-well. The logo that Theresa had in mind had to portray her site and what she wanted to do for her customers.  At first she wanted a logo that was a tooth on wheels to portray that her business was mobile and that she worked in the dental field.  After hearing her idea I confronted her. explaining that her idea of a tooth on wheels as a logo might come off too childish and some people might not take her company serious. I then took a few days to create a logo of a tooth with an arrow moving to demenstrate that her Dental Hygiene was in fact mobile.

                	<p>For the color scheme Theresa picked four different sites and showed me which ones caught her eye the most.  The colors Purple, Blue, and gray where her top choices and so I created a rough draft of what the site would look like in those colors and she loved it.

                                    <p> Theresa and I used the same technic as the color scheme to determine what her website wireframe and over all structure would look like, I had Theresa take four sites that she thought were appealing to her and give me some reasons why and what she liked about them.  Based off the discriptions on what she liked and why I built 3 different templetes that might appeal to her,  She immediately choose the first site due to easy navigation and over all look and feel.

                	<p>The visual design came very easy due to the selections that Theresa had made with the color scheme and wireframe.  The over all look and navigation made Theresa happy and was then given the go a head to start creating the actual site in HTML with place holders for images and text till Theresa could come up with them.  <a class="view_site" href="theresa-website/index.html" target="_new">View Site</a>
