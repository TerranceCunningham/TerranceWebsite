                    	<p>Theresa Marks, founder of Dental Hygiene Mobile Services, PLLC, has over 20 years of experience as a dental hygienist, educator, and college program coordinator. She received her initial dental hygiene training at Cape Cod Community College in Massachusetts. She continued on to receive her Masters of Oral Biology from the University of Washington. It was during this time that she trained as a special needs hygienist in the Department of Oral Biology, DECOD Clinic (Dental Education for the Care of the Disabled). During her time in the DECOD Clinic she observed firsthand the difficulties many patients encounter while trying to obtain preventative dental care. At this time Theresa Marks defined her future; to provide access to preventive dental hygiene for disabled, homebound, patients with dental phobia, and people living in residential facilities. Her philosophy is that preventative dental care enhances health and quality of life.<br /><br />
                        In keeping with that philosophy Theresa Marks continues to give back to the community as an educator specializing in Special Needs Population Seminar, Dental Anatomy, Hygiene Techniques, Restorative Hygiene, Local Anesthesia, Lab Instruction, and Patient Screening Techniques. She trains and inspires her students, primary care providers, and healthcare professionals in Washington to view dental hygienists as an integral part of the healthcare team. She has served as a college professor, community instructor, and member of the Dental Advisory Board and Multicultural Committee. As a department head in Hagerstown, Maryland Theresa Marks developed the Dental Program assessment outcome materials needed for the Middle States Accreditation Site Visit. The program successfully obtained accreditation through the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA).<br /><br />Dental Hygiene Mobile Services, PLLC, is the realization of 20 years of training, experience, and expertise. Theresa Marks is redefining the dental experience and offering a practical solution for disabled, homebound, patients with dental phobia, and people living in residential facilities.</p>
