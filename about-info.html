        <h2>Web Designer</h2>
        <p>Web Design has been a passion of mine ever since I took a computer repair course while I was in high-school. After I built my first computer I wanted to know more about how computers worked and how one puts a web site online. I quickly decided that I wanted to take web development courses after I graduated from high-school so I started to do research on how code worked and what I needed to do to per-sue web development.</p><br />
         
         <h3>Graphic Designer</h3> 
        <p> Through-out Seattle Central Community College web design program I learned about many different ways to create a website and how little graphics can make a website stand out from other sites. I've enjoyed learning about PHP, J-Query and basic HTML, Id like to further my degree by learning more about graphics design so that I can make great art on my customers sites.</p><br />
        
        <h3>Artist</h3>
        	<p>Art has always been a passion of mine, I find that while I create a website I use different types of art. I'm not only creating a site for you, Im also making it look appealing as-well. The art that goes into making a site can be anywhere from architecture to visual design. Creating a site not only needs these basic elements, but to really spice your website you need to create easy navigation for your clients.<br /></p>
